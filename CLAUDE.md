# Site

Brochure site and OAuth2 playground for the Olympus identity platform.

## Versioning

**Always use `octl bump` to bump versions** — never manually edit version numbers in `package.json`.
`octl bump` handles the full flow: discovers the highest version across all repos, bumps canvas first, waits for npm publish, then updates all downstream repos together.

## Agent System

This repo is part of the [Olympus agent system](../docs/teams/ciam-team.md) — an 18-agent team that operates as a continuous product development loop.

- **Engineer agent**: [`docs/agents/ciam-engineer-site.md`](../docs/agents/ciam-engineer-site.md)
- **Cross-functional reviewers**: Architect, Security Expert, QA Engineer, DX Expert, Technical Writer
- **Key docs**: [`../docs/`](../docs/) — philosophy, file structure, team definition, dependency map, system status

### Dependencies

- **Consumes**: `@olympus/canvas` (design system), Hydra (OAuth2 playground) via platform
- **Consumed by**: platform (compose configs mount this repo for dev)
